# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Pre-1.0, the **minor version equals the phase number**.

## [Unreleased]

### Phase 0 — Foundation

**Added**
- Godot 4.6.1-stable-mono project skeleton with all autoloads registered (`Settings`, `EventBus`, `SaveManager`, `TimeManager`, `GameState`, `AudioManager`, `Narrator`).
- `EventBus` signal catalog covering catching, inventory/currency, progression, pets/battle, prestige, crafting, lifecycle, and narrator events.
- `BigNumber` mantissa/exponent class with `add`/`subtract`/`multiply`/`divide`/`pow_int`/`compare`/`format` and full GUT test coverage.
- `SaveManager` with atomic `user://save.json` writes, `LocalFileBackend`, and a migration-chain framework (no migrations needed yet, but the framework is exercised by a v0→v1 fixture test).
- Resource schemas for monsters, pets, nets, items, upgrades, crafting recipes, and dialogue lines.
- Placeholder `main.tscn` showing "Critterancher".
- GUT 9.x vendored at `addons/gut/`.
- GitHub Actions workflows: `build.yml` (test + Windows/Web/Android-debug) and `release.yml` (signed AAB on tag).
- ADRs 0001–0007 covering engine, language, content-as-resources, save format, BigNumber, deterministic battles, and platform priority.

**Why it matters**

Phase 0 establishes the abstractions every later phase depends on: BigNumber for currency, the migration chain for save evolution, the EventBus for cross-system decoupling, and the Resource layer for content-driven scaling. Nothing is gameplay yet — but the next six phases can be additive.

**Tests**
- `test_big_number.gd` — 9 cases including normalization, mixed-exponent arithmetic, divide-by-zero handling, and formatter output.
- `test_save_migration.gd` — fixture v0 save migrates to current shape without data loss.
- `test_save_round_trip.gd` — populated `GameState` survives save → clear → load equality check.

**Pre-push checklist (Phase 0 + 0a)**
- ✓ GUT exits 0 (14/14 tests pass)
- ✓ Windows export builds and launches headlessly without errors
- ✓ Web export builds (uses the standard non-mono Godot binary locally; CI uses non-mono throughout)
- ✓ Android debug APK builds locally via Godot's GUI export and on CI Linux runners. Phase 0a unblocker was `rendering/textures/vram_compression/import_etc2_astc=true` in `project.godot` — Godot's Android exporter silently rejects projects without ETC2/ASTC import enabled, since GLES doesn't support S3TC/BPTC.
- ✓ CI green on `main` (run [25192707991](https://github.com/NickSanft/IdleBeastPractices/actions/runs/25192707991))
- ✓ Tag `phase-0-complete` pushed
