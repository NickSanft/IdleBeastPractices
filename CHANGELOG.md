# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Pre-1.0, the **minor version equals the phase number**.

## [Unreleased]

### Phase 1 — MVP catch loop

**Added**
- `CatchingSystem` (`game/systems/catching_system.gd`): pure functions for `pick_spawn` (tier + net-targets weighted choice), `resolve_tap` (difficulty-gated catch with per-monster drops + gold + shiny roll), `resolve_auto`, and `auto_catch_count` (fractional accumulator).
- `OfflineProgressSystem` (`game/systems/offline_progress_system.gd`): per-species distribution of expected catches, normal-approximation Poisson for shiny variance, BigNumber gold accumulation, configurable cap (default 1 hour).
- `ContentRegistry` (`game/systems/content_registry.gd`): lazy-loaded index of monsters/items/nets keyed by `id`. Single source for any scene that needs the spawnable pool.
- 9 `MonsterResource` `.tres` files across tiers 1–3 with per-species spawn weight, catch difficulty, drop range, gold base, shiny rate, and color tint.
- 3 `ItemResource` `.tres` files (`wisplet_ectoplasm`, `centiphantom_jelly`, `hush_pollen`).
- 1 `NetResource` `.tres` file (`basic_net`, cost 100 gold, 0.5 catches/sec, spawn_max 3, targets tier 1).
- `MonsterInstance` scene + script: wandering pixel-sprite with click/touch input, tap_progress accumulator, and a catch-and-despawn tween.
- `CatchingView` scene: spawn loop, auto-catch loop, tap handling, and tier-completion gate (≥25 catches of any species in the active tier AND all 3 species seen → unlock next tier).
- UI components: `CurrencyBar` (BigNumber-formatted gold + RP placeholder), `InventoryPanel` (grouped item list), `NetShop` (buy/equip nets), `WelcomeBackDialog` (offline summary).
- Main scene upgraded from placeholder to a tabbed layout: Catch · Inventory · Shop, with a currency bar pinned at the top.
- `GameState` helpers: `add_gold`, `try_spend_gold`, `add_item`, `record_tap`, `record_catch`, `purchase_net`, `current_gold`, `current_rancher_points` — and EventBus signal emissions for currency / inventory / first-catch / first-shiny.
- `MonsterResource.tint` and `MonsterResource.gold_base` fields. Tint allows the 3 within-tier color variants to share one sprite sheet; gold_base centralizes per-species reward values from the §6 design table.

**Why it matters**

Phase 1 turns Phase 0's scaffolding into something playable. A first-launch player can tap monsters, accumulate gold, buy a net, watch it auto-catch, and progress through three tiers in a 20-minute session. Offline progress closes the loop for short returns. The systems layer stays pure — every catch goes through `CatchingSystem` and every offline window through `OfflineProgressSystem`, both of which are unit-tested independently of the scene tree.

**Tests (32 passing, 0 failing)**
- `test_catching_system.gd` (11 cases): tier-filter, max-tier filter, null on empty pool, tap-below-difficulty, tap-at-difficulty, drop range bounds, seeded RNG determinism, auto-catch accumulator carry, zero-dt no-op.
- `test_offline_progress.gd` (8 cases): zero-elapsed empty summary, cap enforcement, cap-multiplier extension, spawn-weight distribution sanity, BigNumber gold band, tier gate, zero-rate skip, null-net safe.
- Phase 0 tests still green (BigNumber, save migration, save round-trip).

**Pre-push checklist (Phase 1)**
- ✓ GUT 32/32 passing
- ✓ Project boots clean headlessly with `--quit-after 60` (no script errors)
- ✓ Local Windows export builds and ships
- ✓ CI green on `main` (run [25195407762](https://github.com/NickSanft/IdleBeastPractices/actions/runs/25195407762)) — tests + Windows + Web + Android all four jobs
- ✓ Tag `phase-1-complete` pushed

### Phase 0 — Foundation

**Added**
- Godot 4.6.1-stable-mono project skeleton with all autoloads registered (`Settings`, `EventBus`, `SaveManager`, `TimeManager`, `GameState`, `AudioManager`, `Narrator`).
- `EventBus` signal catalog covering catching, inventory/currency, progression, pets/battle, prestige, crafting, lifecycle, and narrator events.
- `BigNumber` mantissa/exponent class with `add`/`subtract`/`multiply`/`divide`/`pow_int`/`compare`/`format` and full GUT test coverage.
- `SaveManager` with atomic `user://save.json` writes, `LocalFileBackend`, and a migration-chain framework (no migrations needed yet, but the framework is exercised by a v0→v1 fixture test).
- Resource schemas for monsters, pets, nets, items, upgrades, crafting recipes, and dialogue lines.
- Placeholder `main.tscn` showing "Critterancher".
- GUT 9.x vendored at `addons/gut/`.
- GitHub Actions workflows: `build.yml` (test + Windows/Web/Android-debug) and `release.yml` (signed AAB on tag).
- ADRs 0001–0007 covering engine, language, content-as-resources, save format, BigNumber, deterministic battles, and platform priority.

**Why it matters**

Phase 0 establishes the abstractions every later phase depends on: BigNumber for currency, the migration chain for save evolution, the EventBus for cross-system decoupling, and the Resource layer for content-driven scaling. Nothing is gameplay yet — but the next six phases can be additive.

**Tests**
- `test_big_number.gd` — 9 cases including normalization, mixed-exponent arithmetic, divide-by-zero handling, and formatter output.
- `test_save_migration.gd` — fixture v0 save migrates to current shape without data loss.
- `test_save_round_trip.gd` — populated `GameState` survives save → clear → load equality check.

**Pre-push checklist (Phase 0 + 0a)**
- ✓ GUT exits 0 (14/14 tests pass)
- ✓ Windows export builds and launches headlessly without errors
- ✓ Web export builds (uses the standard non-mono Godot binary locally; CI uses non-mono throughout)
- ✓ Android debug APK builds locally via Godot's GUI export and on CI Linux runners. Phase 0a unblocker was `rendering/textures/vram_compression/import_etc2_astc=true` in `project.godot` — Godot's Android exporter silently rejects projects without ETC2/ASTC import enabled, since GLES doesn't support S3TC/BPTC.
- ✓ CI green on `main` (run [25192707991](https://github.com/NickSanft/IdleBeastPractices/actions/runs/25192707991))
- ✓ Tag `phase-0-complete` pushed
